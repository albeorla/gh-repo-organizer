"""Domain objects and ports related to *source control* / GitHub.

This bounded context deals with everything required to **retrieve** source
code metadata â€“ independent of the concrete technology (GitHub REST, GitHub
CLI, Git, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

Keeping the domain model free from infrastructure-specific details enables
easier testing, clearer boundaries and strict adherence to the Dependency
Inversion Principle (DIP).
