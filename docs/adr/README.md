# Architecture Decision Records

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the GitHub Repository Organizer project. ADRs are used to document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. It provides:

- A clear record of the decision made
- The context in which it was made
- The reasoning behind it
- The consequences and trade-offs

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

```markdown
# ADR NNNN: Title

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Date

YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

[Description of the problem and context]

## Decision

[Description of the decision made]

## Consequences

### Positive

[Positive consequences]

### Negative

[Negative consequences]

## Implementation Strategy

[How the decision will be implemented]

## Technical Debt

[Any technical debt created or addressed]
```

## List of ADRs

1. [ADR 0001: Domain-Driven Design Architecture](0001-ddd-architecture.md)
2. [ADR 0002: Repository Action Decisions](0002-repository-action-decisions.md)

## Creating New ADRs

When creating a new ADR:

1. Create a new file named `NNNN-title.md` where NNNN is the next number in sequence
2. Use the ADR template format
3. Add a link to the new ADR in this README
4. Submit for review as part of a pull request

## Relationship to Technical Debt

ADRs help track technical debt by:

1. Documenting known trade-offs and consequences
2. Providing context for why certain approaches were chosen
3. Making it clear which decisions might need to be revisited
4. Creating transparency about architectural evolution

The ROADMAP.md file at the project root complements these ADRs by prioritizing work items based on the decisions documented here.
