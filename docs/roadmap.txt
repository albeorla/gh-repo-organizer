# GitHub Repository Organizer Roadmap

## 1. Project Overview

The GitHub Repository Organizer is a command-line tool designed to help developers analyze and organize their GitHub repositories using AI-powered insights. Using Claude AI, the tool evaluates each repository's purpose, value, and activity level, then recommends specific actions (DELETE/ARCHIVE/EXTRACT/KEEP/PIN) with clear reasoning. The project follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture for improved maintainability and is currently transitioning through its architectural refactoring phase while preparing to enhance its analysis capabilities.

## 2. Completed Items

- **Core GitHub API Integration**: REST-based GitHub API integration for fetching repository data, including metadata, languages, commit history, and contributor information
- **LLM Analysis with Claude**: Integration with Claude AI via LangChain for repository analysis with extended thinking capabilities
- **CLI Interface with Rich Output**: Modern command-line interface using Typer and Rich libraries with commands for analyze, cleanup, logs, reports, reset
- **Repository Analysis and Reporting**: Generation of detailed markdown reports for each repository with strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations
- **Rate Limiting and Error Handling**: Configurable rate limiting for both GitHub and LLM APIs with retry mechanisms
- **Partial DDD Architecture Implementation**:
  - Established bounded contexts for analysis and source control
  - Created domain models and interfaces (protocols)
  - Implemented initial infrastructure adapters for GitHub and Claude
  - Documented architecture decisions in ADRs

# Release Plan Analysis

I'll start by analyzing the PRD and roadmap to identify core features, assess their implementation status, and prioritize them for the MVP release.

<release_plan_analysis>
## Core Features Identification and Prioritization

I'll extract all the key features from the PRD and roadmap, rate their importance for an MVP, note their implementation status, and provide rationale for prioritization.

### 1. GitHub API Integration
- **Importance for MVP**: 5/5
- **Implementation Status**: COMPLETED
- **Rationale**: This is the fundamental capability to fetch repository data from GitHub, without which the application cannot function. It's the foundation for all other features and is essential for the MVP.

### 2. LLM Analysis with Claude
- **Importance for MVP**: 5/5
- **Implementation Status**: COMPLETED
- **Rationale**: Core analysis functionality using Claude AI is the main value proposition of the tool and distinguishes it from basic GitHub clients. It's essential for generating insights about repositories.

### 3. Basic CLI Interface
- **Importance for MVP**: 5/5
- **Implementation Status**: COMPLETED
- **Rationale**: Users need a way to interact with the application. The CLI interface is the only planned interface according to the PRD, so it's critical for the MVP.

### 4. Repository Analysis and Basic Reporting
- **Importance for MVP**: 5/5
- **Implementation Status**: COMPLETED
- **Rationale**: Generating analysis reports is a core function and provides the main value to users. Without this capability, the tool would not serve its purpose.

### 5. Rate Limiting and Error Handling
- **Importance for MVP**: 4/5
- **Implementation Status**: COMPLETED
- **Rationale**: Important for reliable operation when interacting with external APIs (GitHub and Claude). Without proper rate limiting, the tool could hit API limits and become unusable.

### 6. Domain-Driven Design Architecture
- **Importance for MVP**: 2/5
- **Implementation Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Rationale**: While good architecture is important for maintainability and future development, a partial implementation is sufficient for an MVP. The complete DDD architecture transition is more important for long-term development than for initial user value.

### 7. Action Recommendations (DELETE/ARCHIVE/EXTRACT/KEEP/PIN)
- **Importance for MVP**: 5/5
- **Implementation Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Rationale**: This is central to the product's goal of helping users organize repositories. The specific action recommendations are mentioned in the introduction of the PRD, indicating they are core to the product's purpose.

### 8. Detailed Reasoning for Recommendations
- **Importance for MVP**: 4/5
- **Implementation Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Rationale**: Providing reasoning helps users trust and act on recommendations. This is important but could be enhanced in subsequent releases.

### 9. Enhanced LLM Prompts for Better Recommendations
- **Importance for MVP**: 3/5
- **Implementation Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Rationale**: Improving the quality of recommendations is important but can be iteratively enhanced after the initial MVP.

### 10. Categorized Summary Reports by Value
- **Importance for MVP**: 4/5
- **Implementation Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Rationale**: Categorization helps users prioritize actions and understand their repository portfolio at a glance, making it an important feature for the initial value proposition.

### 11. Bulk Action Execution
- **Importance for MVP**: 2/5
- **Implementation Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Rationale**: While convenient, this is an efficiency feature rather than a core capability. Users can manually execute actions based on recommendations in the MVP.

### 12. Application Layer Refinements (DI, Command/Query separation)
- **Importance for MVP**: 1/5
- **Implementation Status**: NOT STARTED/PARTIAL
- **Rationale**: These are architectural improvements that don't directly affect user experience or core functionality.

### 13. Domain Events Implementation
- **Importance for MVP**: 1/5
- **Implementation Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Rationale**: Important for system architecture but not critical for MVP functionality from the user's perspective.

### 14. Repository Pattern for Data Persistence
- **Importance for MVP**: 2/5
- **Implementation Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Rationale**: Improved data handling is important but the current implementation is likely sufficient for an MVP.

### 15. Advanced CLI Features and Data Visualization
- **Importance for MVP**: 2/5
- **Implementation Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Rationale**: Basic CLI capabilities are sufficient for MVP. Advanced features and visualizations can be added in later releases.

### 16. Testing and Quality Improvements
- **Importance for MVP**: 3/5
- **Implementation Status**: NOT STARTED/MINIMAL
- **Rationale**: Some level of testing is important for reliability, but comprehensive testing can be expanded in later releases.

## Considerations for Quick MVP Delivery

1. **Leverage Completed Components**: The core GitHub API integration, LLM analysis with Claude, basic CLI interface, and repository analysis reporting are already completed, providing a solid foundation for the MVP.

2. **Focus on Action Recommendations**: Since action recommendations (DELETE/ARCHIVE/EXTRACT/KEEP/PIN) are central to the product's value proposition and are already in progress, prioritize completing this feature for the MVP.

3. **Minimize Architectural Refactoring**: While DDD architecture is valuable long-term, extensive refactoring can delay the MVP. Focus on completing only the architectural components necessary for core functionality.

4. **Keep the MVP Focused**: Limit the scope to the essential features that deliver the primary value proposition - analyzing GitHub repositories and providing actionable recommendations.

5. **Defer Enhancement Features**: Features that enhance existing functionality (like improved prompts, bulk actions, advanced visualization) can be deferred to post-MVP releases.

6. **Implement Basic Error Handling**: Ensure the MVP has sufficient error handling for a reliable user experience, but defer comprehensive error handling across all layers.

7. **Prioritize User-Facing Features**: Focus on features that directly impact the user experience and value proposition, rather than internal architectural improvements.

8. **Consider Technical Debt**: Be mindful of technical debt that might be introduced by expediting the MVP, and plan to address it in subsequent releases.
</release_plan_analysis>

Based on my analysis, I'll now create a phased release plan starting with the P0 release (MVP) followed by subsequent releases.

The P0 release will focus on delivering the core functionality that provides immediate value to users - analyzing GitHub repositories and providing actionable recommendations. This includes features with high importance ratings (4-5) that are either completed or far along in implementation.

P1 and P2 releases will add enhancements and additional capabilities based on their importance and implementation status.
