# Task ID: 19
# Title: Remove legacy repo models module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the deprecated repo_models.py file that only exists for backward compatibility
# Details:
The file src/repo_organizer/models/repo_models.py is explicitly marked as a legacy module for backward compatibility. It simply re-exports models from infrastructure/analysis/pydantic_models.py. Remove this file to reduce code duplication and simplify the codebase.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify all imports of the legacy repo_models module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Find all files in the codebase that import from repo_models.py to understand the impact of removal
### Details:
Use grep, git grep, or code search tools to find all import statements referencing 'repo_models' or specific models from this file. Create a list of all files that need to be updated. Check for imports like 'from repo_organizer.models.repo_models import X' or 'import repo_organizer.models.repo_models as Y'. Document each occurrence with file path and line number.

## 2. Update import statements to use direct imports [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Modify all files that import from repo_models.py to import directly from infrastructure/analysis/pydantic_models.py
### Details:
For each file identified in subtask 1, replace imports from 'repo_organizer.models.repo_models' with direct imports from 'infrastructure/analysis/pydantic_models.py'. Ensure the import paths are correct relative to each file. Run tests after each file update to verify functionality is maintained. Document all changes made for future reference.

## 3. Remove the legacy repo_models.py file [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Delete the deprecated repo_models.py file and verify application functionality
### Details:
Once all imports have been updated, delete the src/repo_organizer/models/repo_models.py file. Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions. Update any documentation that might reference this file. If the models directory becomes empty after removal, consider if it should also be removed. Commit the change with a clear message explaining the removal of the legacy module.
