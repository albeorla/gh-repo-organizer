# Task ID: 22
# Title: Remove duplicate CLI commands implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the duplicate CLI commands implementation in the interface directory
# Details:
The file src/repo_organizer/interface/cli/commands.py is a duplicate of src/repo_organizer/cli/commands.py. The CLI modules in the codebase import from cli/commands.py, not from interface/cli/commands.py. Remove the duplicate to simplify the codebase.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit imports and usage of CLI commands [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify all modules and scripts in the codebase that import CLI commands to confirm they use src/repo_organizer/cli/commands.py and not the duplicate in the interface directory.
### Details:
Search the codebase for imports of CLI commands. Ensure that all references point to src/repo_organizer/cli/commands.py. If any reference src/repo_organizer/interface/cli/commands.py, update them to use the correct path. This ensures removing the duplicate will not break functionality.

## 2. Remove the duplicate CLI commands file [done]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Delete src/repo_organizer/interface/cli/commands.py from the codebase to eliminate redundancy.
### Details:
After confirming no module depends on the duplicate file, safely delete src/repo_organizer/interface/cli/commands.py. Remove any related empty directories if they become obsolete after the file deletion.

## 3. Test CLI functionality and clean up references [done]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Run all relevant tests and manually verify the CLI to ensure it works as expected after the duplicate removal. Remove any obsolete references or documentation.
### Details:
Execute the test suite for CLI functionality. Launch the CLI and run a few representative commands to confirm correct behavior. Search for and remove any lingering references or documentation pointing to the deleted file.
