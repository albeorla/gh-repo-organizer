# Task ID: 23
# Title: Remove duplicate configuration settings module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the duplicate configuration settings module in the infrastructure directory
# Details:
The file src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/config/settings.py is a duplicate of src/repo_organizer/config/settings.py. Based on import patterns, the version in the config directory is actively used. Remove the duplicate to centralize configuration and reduce confusion.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze import patterns and verify configuration usage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine all imports of configuration settings throughout the codebase to confirm which module is actively used and identify any references to the duplicate
### Details:
Use tools like grep or your IDE's search functionality to find all instances where either 'src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/config/settings.py' or 'src/repo_organizer/config/settings.py' is imported. Create a comprehensive list of all files that import configuration settings and note which version they're using. Verify that the version in the config directory is indeed the actively used one as mentioned in the task description. Look for any imports that might be using the duplicate in the infrastructure directory. This step is crucial to ensure we understand the current usage patterns before making changes.

## 2. Update any imports referencing the duplicate module [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Modify any code that imports from the duplicate configuration module to use the primary module instead
### Details:
For any files identified in subtask 1 that import from 'src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/config/settings.py', update the import statements to reference 'src/repo_organizer/config/settings.py' instead. This might involve changing import paths like 'from repo_organizer.infrastructure.config.settings import X' to 'from repo_organizer.config.settings import X'. Make sure to run tests after each file change to ensure functionality is preserved. If there are many files to update, consider using automated refactoring tools that can safely perform this change across multiple files.

## 3. Remove the duplicate module and verify application functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Delete the duplicate configuration file and run comprehensive tests to ensure the application still functions correctly
### Details:
After all imports have been updated, remove the duplicate file at 'src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/config/settings.py'. Run the full test suite to verify that the application continues to function correctly. Also manually test key functionality that relies on configuration settings. If the infrastructure directory's config folder becomes empty after removing this file, consider whether the empty directory should also be removed to keep the codebase clean. Document the change in the project documentation, noting that configuration settings are now centralized in 'src/repo_organizer/config/settings.py'.
