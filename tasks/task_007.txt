# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Configuration Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Add validation for environment variables and configuration settings
# Details:
Create a configuration module in the infrastructure layer. Implement validation for all environment variables. Provide clear error messages for missing or invalid configuration. Use a library like Pydantic for validation if appropriate. Create configuration objects that can be injected into services.

# Test Strategy:
Test configuration validation with various valid and invalid inputs. Verify error messages are clear and actionable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Configuration Module Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic structure for the configuration module in the infrastructure layer
### Details:
Create a new module named `config.py` in the infrastructure layer. Define the basic structure including imports for environment variable handling (os.environ) and validation tools. If using Pydantic, import BaseModel and validator decorators. Create a skeleton for the main Config class that will hold all validated configuration values. Include docstrings explaining the purpose of the module and how it should be used by other components.

## 2. Implement Configuration Validation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Add validation rules for all environment variables and configuration settings
### Details:
Implement validation logic for all required environment variables. For each variable, define type constraints, range/format validations, and default values where appropriate. If using Pydantic, create model fields with appropriate types and constraints. For complex validations, implement custom validator methods. Group related configuration settings (e.g., database, API, logging) into logical sections. Include comprehensive error handling that provides clear messages identifying which specific configuration value is invalid or missing and why.

## 3. Create Configuration Injection Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement a system for injecting validated configuration into services
### Details:
Create a singleton pattern or factory function that returns the validated configuration object. Implement a mechanism to load configuration from environment variables at application startup. Add helper methods to access specific configuration groups. Write unit tests to verify that validation works correctly for valid and invalid inputs. Document how other services should request and use the configuration objects, with code examples. Ensure thread safety if the application is multi-threaded. Add logging of configuration values at startup (with sensitive values masked).
