# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Comprehensive Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive test suite covering all critical components
# Details:
Create unit tests for all domain models, services, and repositories. Implement integration tests for cross-component interactions. Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows. Set up test fixtures and factories for common test scenarios. Ensure test coverage for edge cases and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Use a coverage tool to identify untested code. Implement test-driven development for new components. Create a CI pipeline to run tests automatically.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up test infrastructure and utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure testing frameworks, create test helpers, and establish test fixtures/factories
### Details:
Install and configure testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha, or JUnit depending on tech stack). Create test utilities for common operations like database setup/teardown. Implement test fixtures and factories for generating test data consistently across all test types. Set up mocking utilities for external dependencies. Configure test runners and reporting tools for clear test results visualization.

## 2. Implement unit tests for domain models [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for all domain models and their methods
### Details:
Write unit tests for each domain model class, ensuring all public methods are tested. Cover standard use cases, edge cases, and error conditions. Use the test fixtures created in subtask 1 to generate test data. Aim for high code coverage (>90%) for model classes. Test validation logic, business rules, and any complex calculations within models. Organize tests to mirror the structure of the domain model packages.

## 3. Develop unit tests for services and repositories [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create unit tests for all service and repository classes with appropriate mocking
### Details:
Write unit tests for all service classes, mocking their dependencies (repositories, external services). Test repositories with appropriate database test doubles or isolated test databases. Cover standard operations, error handling, and edge cases. Test transaction management and concurrency handling where applicable. Ensure proper isolation between tests to prevent test interference. Use the test fixtures from subtask 1 for consistent test data.

## 4. Create integration tests for component interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement integration tests that verify correct interactions between components
### Details:
Develop integration tests that verify multiple components working together correctly. Test API endpoints with realistic request/response cycles. Create tests for database interactions that verify ORM/repository implementations against actual database. Test service-to-service communication patterns. Focus on boundaries between architectural layers (e.g., controller-to-service, service-to-repository). Use test containers or similar technologies for external dependencies when needed.

## 5. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.4
### Description: Create end-to-end tests that verify complete user journeys through the system
### Details:
Identify and document critical user flows through the application. Implement automated end-to-end tests for each flow using appropriate tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, TestCafe). Create realistic test scenarios that mimic actual user behavior. Test happy paths thoroughly and important error paths. Ensure proper test environment setup and teardown to prevent test pollution. Implement reporting that clearly shows which user journeys are covered and working correctly.
