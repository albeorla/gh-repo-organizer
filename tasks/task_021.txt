# Task ID: 21
# Title: Remove duplicate LLM service implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the duplicate LLM service implementation in the services directory
# Details:
The file src/repo_organizer/services/llm_service.py is a duplicate of src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/analysis/llm_service.py. According to the DDD architecture, the version in the infrastructure layer is the correct placement. Remove the duplicate to simplify the codebase.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and update all references to the duplicate service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Search the codebase for any imports or references to src/repo_organizer/services/llm_service.py and update them to use src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/analysis/llm_service.py instead.
### Details:
Use global search tools or IDE features to locate all instances where the old duplicate service is imported or used. Carefully update import statements and any type hints or references. Run static analysis or linter to catch any missed references.

## 2. Remove the duplicate LLM service implementation file [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Delete src/repo_organizer/services/llm_service.py from the codebase since it is a duplicate and not the correct placement according to DDD architecture.
### Details:
After confirming all references are updated, safely delete the duplicate file. Ensure the version in infrastructure remains untouched. Commit the removal separately for traceability.

## 3. Test and validate codebase after removal [done]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Run all relevant tests and perform code review to ensure the removal did not introduce any issues or broken dependencies.
### Details:
Execute the full test suite, focusing on areas that previously depended on the duplicate service. Review code coverage reports for any gaps. Address any failures or import errors that arise, and confirm that the application behavior remains correct.
