# Task ID: 21
# Title: Remove duplicate LLM service implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the duplicate LLM service implementation in the services directory
# Details:
The file src/repo_organizer/services/llm_service.py is a duplicate of src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/analysis/llm_service.py. According to the DDD architecture, the version in the infrastructure layer is the correct placement. Remove the duplicate to simplify the codebase.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze differences between duplicate LLM service implementations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compare the two LLM service implementations to identify any unique functionality or differences between them that might need to be preserved.
### Details:
Compare src/repo_organizer/services/llm_service.py and src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/analysis/llm_service.py line by line. Document any differences in functionality, method signatures, or implementation details. Check if there are any unique features in the services directory version that need to be migrated to the infrastructure version. Also verify that the infrastructure version is complete and correctly implements all required functionality.

## 2. Update import references to use infrastructure LLM service [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Find and update all import statements and references that currently use the services directory implementation to use the infrastructure implementation instead.
### Details:
Search the entire codebase for imports of 'src/repo_organizer/services/llm_service.py' or any classes/functions from it. Update these imports to reference 'src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/analysis/llm_service.py' instead. Be careful to maintain the correct import structure based on the calling module's location. Run tests after making these changes to ensure everything still works correctly. If the import paths are significantly different, you may need to update code that uses these imports as well.

## 3. Remove the duplicate LLM service file and verify functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Delete the duplicate LLM service file from the services directory and run tests to ensure the application still functions correctly.
### Details:
After all references have been updated to use the infrastructure implementation, delete the file src/repo_organizer/services/llm_service.py. Run the full test suite to verify that removing this file doesn't break any functionality. If tests fail, investigate the cause and fix any remaining references or dependencies. Also check if there are any documentation references to the removed file that need to be updated. Finally, verify that the application still runs correctly in a development environment.
