# Task ID: 10
# Title: Final Integration and Regression Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform final integration testing and fix any regressions in the main analysis flow
# Details:
Conduct end-to-end testing of the complete system. Fix any regressions in the main analysis flow. Verify all components work together correctly. Ensure the system meets all requirements specified in the PRD. Document any known issues or limitations.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive end-to-end tests covering all user scenarios. Test with real GitHub repositories if possible. Verify performance and resource usage. Conduct user acceptance testing if appropriate.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Integration Test Plan and Environment Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive test plan for end-to-end testing and prepare the test environment
### Details:
Create a detailed test plan document covering all system components and their interactions. Define test scenarios that verify each requirement in the PRD. Include positive and negative test cases. Set up a dedicated test environment that mirrors production. Configure monitoring tools to track system behavior during testing. Prepare test data sets that exercise all major functionality paths.

## 2. Execute End-to-End Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Run the full suite of integration tests according to the test plan and document all issues found
### Details:
Execute all test cases defined in the test plan. Test the complete analysis flow from data input to final output. Verify all API contracts between components. Test performance under expected load conditions. Document all issues discovered during testing with detailed reproduction steps. Categorize issues by severity and component. Create tickets for each issue in the tracking system.

## 3. Fix Regressions and Critical Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Address and resolve all regressions and critical issues identified during integration testing
### Details:
Prioritize issues based on severity and impact on core functionality. Fix all regressions in the main analysis flow first. Debug integration issues between components. Address performance bottlenecks identified during testing. Implement fixes with minimal changes to reduce risk of new issues. Create unit tests for each fix to prevent future regressions. Verify each fix in isolation before proceeding to the next issue.

## 4. Final Verification and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Perform final verification of all fixes and create comprehensive documentation of system status
### Details:
Re-run the complete test suite to verify all fixes. Confirm that no new issues were introduced during the fix process. Validate that all requirements in the PRD are met. Create a final test report documenting test coverage and results. Document any known issues or limitations that remain. Include workarounds for any known issues. Create release notes highlighting the current system capabilities and constraints. Get final approval from stakeholders on the system status.
