# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Action Implementation Scripts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop scripts to help users implement recommended repository actions
# Details:
Create scripts to implement DELETE, ARCHIVE, EXTRACT, KEEP, and PIN actions. Add confirmation prompts before destructive actions. Implement dry-run mode for testing. Add logging of actions taken. Consider implementing batch operations for multiple repositories.

# Test Strategy:
Test scripts with mock GitHub API. Verify correct API calls are made for each action. Test confirmation prompts and dry-run mode.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement core action script architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational script structure with command-line interface, configuration handling, and repository connection functionality
### Details:
Develop a base script that handles command-line arguments (including dry-run flag), configuration file parsing, and connecting to repositories. Implement a modular architecture that will allow different action types to be added as modules. Include error handling framework and logging infrastructure. Create the script entry point and basic documentation for usage.

## 2. Implement non-destructive action modules (KEEP and PIN) [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop script modules for non-destructive repository actions
### Details:
Building on the core architecture, implement the KEEP and PIN action modules. For KEEP, create functionality to mark repositories for retention. For PIN, implement functionality to mark repositories as important/pinned in the system. Add appropriate logging for these actions. Test these non-destructive actions thoroughly and document their usage in the README.

## 3. Implement destructive action modules with safety features [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Develop script modules for potentially destructive actions (DELETE, ARCHIVE, EXTRACT) with confirmation prompts and safeguards
### Details:
Implement DELETE, ARCHIVE, and EXTRACT action modules. Include confirmation prompts that clearly state the consequences of each action and require explicit user confirmation before proceeding. Ensure dry-run mode shows what would happen without executing destructive operations. Add detailed logging of all actions taken or simulated. Implement safety checks to prevent accidental data loss (e.g., checking repository status before deletion).

## 4. Implement batch operations and finalize documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Add functionality to perform actions on multiple repositories and complete comprehensive documentation
### Details:
Enhance the scripts to support batch operations, allowing users to apply actions to multiple repositories at once. Implement options for filtering repositories by criteria (e.g., age, size, name pattern) for batch operations. Add summary reporting for batch operations. Create comprehensive documentation covering all implemented actions, their parameters, safety features, and examples of common use cases. Include troubleshooting information and best practices.
