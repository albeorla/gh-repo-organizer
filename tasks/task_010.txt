# Task ID: 10
# Title: Set up testing framework and initial tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework with initial tests for core functionality.
# Details:
1. Set up pytest testing framework
2. Create mock objects for GitHub and LLM APIs
3. Implement unit tests for domain models and services
4. Create integration tests for application layer
5. Implement test fixtures with sample repository data
6. Add test coverage reporting
7. Create CI configuration for automated testing
8. Implement performance benchmarks for critical operations

# Test Strategy:
Verify test coverage across all components. Ensure mocks accurately simulate API behavior. Test both success and failure paths. Validate integration tests with end-to-end scenarios. Measure performance benchmarks for baseline metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up pytest framework with mock objects [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the pytest testing framework and create necessary mock objects for external dependencies
### Details:
1. Install pytest and required plugins (pytest-cov, pytest-mock)
2. Create a tests/ directory structure
3. Implement mock objects for GitHub API interactions
4. Implement mock objects for LLM API interactions
5. Create basic test configuration (pytest.ini or conftest.py)
6. Set up test fixtures for dependency injection

## 2. Implement core unit and integration tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create the initial set of unit and integration tests for core functionality
### Details:
1. Write unit tests for domain models (Repository, Issue, PR, etc.)
2. Write unit tests for core services
3. Implement integration tests for application layer
4. Create test fixtures with sample repository data
5. Ensure tests cover happy paths and common error cases
6. Organize tests to match the application structure

## 3. Configure test automation and reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Set up test coverage reporting and CI integration for automated testing
### Details:
1. Configure pytest-cov for test coverage reporting
2. Set coverage thresholds (aim for at least 80%)
3. Create CI configuration for GitHub Actions or similar
4. Implement performance benchmarks for critical operations
5. Configure test reports in a format compatible with CI
6. Document testing approach and how to run tests locally
