# Task ID: 10
# Title: Set up testing framework and initial tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework with initial tests for core functionality.
# Details:
1. Set up pytest testing framework
2. Create mock objects for GitHub and LLM APIs
3. Implement unit tests for domain models and services
4. Create integration tests for application layer
5. Implement test fixtures with sample repository data
6. Add test coverage reporting
7. Create CI configuration for automated testing
8. Implement performance benchmarks for critical operations

# Test Strategy:
Verify test coverage across all components. Ensure mocks accurately simulate API behavior. Test both success and failure paths. Validate integration tests with end-to-end scenarios. Measure performance benchmarks for baseline metrics.
