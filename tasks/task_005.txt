# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement application layer orchestration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the application layer to orchestrate the repository analysis process and coordinate between domain services.
# Details:
1. Create ApplicationRunner to coordinate the analysis process
2. Implement AnalyzeRepositoriesUseCase to connect source control with analysis
3. Create ApplicationFactory for dependency injection
4. Implement progress tracking and reporting
5. Add cross-cutting concerns like error handling
6. Create caching mechanism for previously analyzed repositories
7. Implement report generation coordination

# Test Strategy:
Test application runner with mock domain services. Verify use case execution flow. Test progress tracking with different repository counts. Validate caching mechanism with repeated analysis requests. Ensure proper error propagation and handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement core application services and factory [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the fundamental application layer components including ApplicationFactory for dependency injection and the ApplicationRunner to coordinate the repository analysis workflow
### Details:
1. Create ApplicationFactory class to handle dependency injection of all required services
2. Implement ApplicationRunner class with the main orchestration flow
3. Define interfaces for all required dependencies (repositories, analyzers, etc.)
4. Implement basic error handling strategy with appropriate exceptions
5. Create initial unit tests for the application services

## 2. Implement repository analysis use cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create the core use cases that connect source control systems with analysis services and implement the business logic for repository analysis
### Details:
1. Implement AnalyzeRepositoriesUseCase class to coordinate between source control and analysis services
2. Add support for analyzing single and multiple repositories
3. Implement progress tracking mechanism with events or callbacks
4. Create caching layer for previously analyzed repositories
5. Add validation logic for repository inputs
6. Write unit tests for the use cases with mock dependencies

## 3. Implement report generation and output coordination [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create the components responsible for generating reports from analysis results and coordinating the output process
### Details:
1. Implement ReportGenerationCoordinator to manage the report creation process
2. Create adapters between analysis results and report formats
3. Add support for different report output formats (JSON, HTML, etc.)
4. Implement configurable report templates
5. Create progress notification system for long-running report generation
6. Add caching for generated reports
7. Write integration tests for the full workflow from analysis to report generation
