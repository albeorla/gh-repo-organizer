# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Adapter Composition Pattern
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Complete the implementation of all adapters using the composition pattern
# Details:
Refactor existing adapters to use the composition pattern. Create adapter interfaces in the domain layer. Implement concrete adapters in the infrastructure layer. Remove legacy implementations once new adapters are fully tested. Ensure adapters properly translate between external systems and domain models.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each adapter implementation. Write integration tests to verify adapters correctly interact with external systems. Implement test doubles (mocks/stubs) for external dependencies.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Adapter Interfaces in Domain Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create well-defined adapter interfaces in the domain layer that establish the contract between the domain and external systems
### Details:
1. Identify all required adapter interfaces by analyzing domain needs
2. Design interface methods focusing on domain language and concepts
3. Document each interface method with clear input/output specifications
4. Include appropriate error handling patterns in the interfaces
5. Ensure interfaces are independent of any infrastructure concerns
6. Organize interfaces in appropriate domain packages/namespaces

## 2. Implement Concrete Adapters Using Composition [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create concrete adapter implementations in the infrastructure layer using the composition pattern
### Details:
1. For each adapter interface, create a corresponding concrete implementation
2. Use composition to wrap external system clients/services
3. Implement translation logic between external data structures and domain models
4. Handle error conditions from external systems and convert to domain-appropriate exceptions
5. Add logging for debugging and monitoring purposes
6. Implement proper resource management (connection handling, cleanup, etc.)

## 3. Update Dependency Injection Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Configure the dependency injection system to use the new adapter implementations
### Details:
1. Update DI container configuration to register new adapter implementations
2. Create appropriate lifetime management for adapter instances
3. Implement feature flags to allow gradual rollout of new adapters
4. Configure parallel operation of legacy and new adapters during transition
5. Set up monitoring to compare behavior between old and new implementations
6. Document the configuration changes for the development team

## 4. Test and Remove Legacy Adapter Implementations [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Validate the new adapters function correctly and remove the legacy implementations
### Details:
1. Create comprehensive test suite for new adapter implementations
2. Run tests comparing outputs of legacy and new adapters with the same inputs
3. Deploy new adapters to staging environment with feature flags
4. Monitor performance and error rates of new adapters
5. Once validated, update all adapter clients to use the new implementations
6. Remove legacy adapter code and any feature flag conditionals
7. Update documentation to reflect the completed migration
