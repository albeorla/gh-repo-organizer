# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement application layer orchestration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the application layer to orchestrate the repository analysis process and coordinate between domain services.
# Details:
1. Create ApplicationRunner to coordinate the analysis process
2. Implement AnalyzeRepositoriesUseCase to connect source control with analysis
3. Create ApplicationFactory for dependency injection
4. Implement progress tracking and reporting
5. Add cross-cutting concerns like error handling
6. Create caching mechanism for previously analyzed repositories
7. Implement report generation coordination

# Test Strategy:
Test application runner with mock domain services. Verify use case execution flow. Test progress tracking with different repository counts. Validate caching mechanism with repeated analysis requests. Ensure proper error propagation and handling.
