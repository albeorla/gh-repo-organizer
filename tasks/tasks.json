Review Existing Structure\n- The current workspace already contains a `src/repo_organizer/` directory with subfolders: `domain/`, `application/`, `infrastructure/`, `interface/`, and their respective submodules (e.g., `core/`, `analysis/`, `source_control/`, `cli/`).\n- I will compare the actual structure to the planned DDD structure to ensure all required directories and `__init__.py` files exist.\n\n## 2. Planned Actions\n- Verify and, if needed, create the following directories and files:\n  - `src/repo_organizer/domain/` with subfolders: `entities/`, `value_objects/`, `repositories/`, `services/`\n  - `src/repo_organizer/application/` with subfolders: `use_cases/`, `services/`, `dtos/`\n  - `src/repo_organizer/infrastructure/` with subfolders: `repositories/`, `external_services/`, `persistence/`\n  - `src/repo_organizer/interface/` with subfolders: `cli/`, `api/`, `views/`\n- Ensure each directory contains an `__init__.py` file (create if missing).\n- Add `.gitkeep` files to empty directories for version control.\n- Add or update `ARCHITECTURE.md` to document layer responsibilities.\n- Add or update a verification script to check the structure.\n\n## 3. Reasoning\n- This ensures the project adheres to DDD principles and is ready for further development.\n- Having all `__init__.py` files allows for proper Python imports.\n- Documenting the architecture helps onboard new contributors and clarifies design intent.\n\n## 4. Potential Challenges\n- Some subfolders may already exist with different names (e.g., `core/` instead of `entities/`).\n- Need to avoid overwriting existing files or removing custom code.\n- Will log any discrepancies and resolve them as needed.\n\n## 5. Next Steps\n- Run the verification script after making changes to confirm the structure is correct.\n- Mark this subtask as done once the structure matches the plan and is verified.\n</info added on 2025-04-28T00:10:01.885Z>",

Create a test file with different environment configurations\n2. Test missing required fields (should raise validation errors)\n3. Test default values when not specified\n4. Test environment variable overrides\n5. Test .env file loading\n\n## Error Handling\n- Add custom error messages for common configuration issues\n- Implement a configuration validation function that can be called at startup\n- Consider adding a `get_settings()` factory function for dependency injection in FastAPI\n</info added on 2025-04-28T00:21:41.895Z>",

Post-removal verification:\n   - Used coverage report to ensure test coverage remained at 94%\n   - Checked import resolution with `python -c \"from repo_organizer.infrastructure.github_service import GitHubService; print(GitHubService)\"` \n   - Verified no circular dependencies introduced with `import-linter check`\n\n4. Services directory evaluation:\n   - Directory contains 3 other service files totaling 1,245 lines of code\n   - Retained per architecture decision record ADR-007 (services layer separation)\n</info added on 2025-05-02T14:23:17.000Z>\n</info added on 2025-05-01T23:07:04.251Z>",
