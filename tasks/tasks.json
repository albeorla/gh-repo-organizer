Test behavior when handlers raise exceptions\n   - Verify other handlers still execute if one fails\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\n1. Use weak references for long-lived event subscriptions to prevent memory leaks\n2. Consider adding batch processing capabilities for high-volume event scenarios\n3.
