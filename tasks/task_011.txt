# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement User Authentication Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add validation to ensure all operations require a valid username before execution. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access and maintain proper attribution.
# Details:
Modify the application's core execution flow to validate that a username is provided before performing any significant operations. This should include:

1. Create a central authentication validation function that checks if a username is provided and is valid (not empty, properly formatted)
2. Integrate this validation at the entry points of all command executions
3. If no username is provided, the application should halt execution and return a clear error message
4. Log authentication failures for security monitoring
5. Consider implementing a configuration option to specify which operations absolutely require authentication versus those that might work in a read-only mode
6. Update the API/CLI interfaces to make the username parameter required
7. Ensure the username is propagated to all relevant logging and tracking mechanisms

This change should be implemented across all modules that perform GitHub operations, LLM interactions, or file system modifications.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the validation mechanism and its integration points:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test the validation function with valid usernames, empty strings, null values, and malformed inputs
   - Verify proper error messages are generated for invalid cases

2. Integration tests:
   - Attempt to execute each main command without providing a username and verify it fails appropriately
   - Verify commands succeed when valid username is provided
   - Test boundary cases like usernames with special characters or very long usernames

3. Security tests:
   - Verify authentication failures are properly logged
   - Ensure no operations that modify data can be performed without authentication

4. UI/UX tests:
   - Verify error messages are clear and actionable for users
   - Check that documentation and help text clearly indicate username requirements

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Authentication Validation Function [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a central function to validate usernames before any operation is executed
### Details:
Create a new module called `auth_validator.py` that contains:
1. A `validate_username(username)` function that checks if a username is:
   - Not None or empty string
   - Properly formatted (alphanumeric with optional hyphens, underscores)
   - Within reasonable length (e.g., 3-50 characters)
2. A `ValidationResult` class/namedtuple that returns validation status and error message
3. Unit tests to verify validation logic works correctly for valid and invalid inputs
4. Documentation for how to use the validation function

Testing approach: Write unit tests that verify the validation function correctly identifies valid and invalid usernames.

## 2. Create Authentication Configuration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement a configuration system to specify which operations require authentication
### Details:
1. Create a configuration module that defines:
   - Default authentication requirements for different operation types
   - A way to override defaults through configuration files/environment variables
   - Categories for operations (e.g., 'read_only', 'write', 'admin')
2. Implement functions to check if a specific operation requires authentication
3. Create a configuration schema that can be easily extended
4. Add documentation on how to configure authentication requirements

Testing approach: Write tests that verify configuration loading and operation categorization works correctly with different configuration settings.

## 3. Integrate Authentication in Command Execution Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Modify the application's command execution pipeline to validate username before execution
### Details:
1. Identify all command execution entry points in the application
2. Modify the command execution flow to call the validation function before processing commands
3. Add error handling to gracefully exit with appropriate error messages when validation fails
4. Ensure validation results are properly propagated up the call stack
5. Update documentation to reflect the new authentication requirements

Testing approach: Write integration tests that verify commands fail appropriately when no username is provided or when an invalid username is provided.

## 4. Implement Authentication Failure Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Add logging for authentication failures to support security monitoring
### Details:
1. Create a dedicated logger for authentication events
2. Log all authentication failures with relevant details:
   - Timestamp
   - Attempted operation
   - IP address/origin information (if available)
   - Any provided username information (even if invalid)
3. Implement log rotation and retention policies
4. Ensure logs are written in a standardized format for easy parsing
5. Add documentation on how to monitor authentication logs

Testing approach: Write tests that verify authentication failures are properly logged with all required information.

## 5. Update API and CLI Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Modify all user interfaces to require username parameter
### Details:
1. Update CLI argument parsing to require a username parameter
2. Add username parameter validation in API endpoints
3. Update API documentation to reflect the new required parameter
4. Add clear error messages for missing username in all interfaces
5. Implement a consistent way to provide username across different interfaces
6. Update help text and examples to show proper usage with username

Testing approach: Write tests for both CLI and API interfaces to verify they correctly require and validate usernames.

## 6. Propagate Username to Logging and Tracking Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Ensure username is included in all logs and tracking mechanisms
### Details:
1. Modify all logging calls to include the authenticated username
2. Update any tracking or analytics systems to record the username with events
3. Ensure username is included in any generated reports or outputs
4. Create a context system to propagate username through the application
5. Update any database schemas if needed to include username fields
6. Verify username is properly sanitized before inclusion in logs

Testing approach: Write tests that verify username appears correctly in logs and tracking data for various operations.
