# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop core domain models and services
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the domain models and services for repository analysis and action recommendations following DDD principles.
# Details:
1. Create Repository domain model with metadata, languages, commits, and contributors
2. Implement RepoAnalysis domain model with strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations
3. Create AnalysisService for determining repository value and activity
4. Implement ActionRecommendationService for generating DELETE/ARCHIVE/EXTRACT/KEEP/PIN recommendations
5. Define interfaces/protocols for infrastructure adapters
6. Create value objects for recommendations, actions, and assessment results
7. Implement domain events for significant state changes

# Test Strategy:
Unit test domain models with various data scenarios. Verify action recommendation logic with different repository characteristics. Test domain services with mock dependencies. Ensure protocols are properly defined with required methods.
