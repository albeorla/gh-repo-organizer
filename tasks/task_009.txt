# Task ID: 9
# Title: Enhance CLI Output and Reporting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve CLI output with progress reporting and summary reports
# Details:
Add progress bars for long-running operations. Implement colored output for different repository actions. Create summary reports of action recommendations. Add filtering options to view different repository actions. Use libraries like rich or tqdm for enhanced console output.

# Test Strategy:
Test output formatting with various inputs. Verify summary reports contain accurate information. Test filtering functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Colored Output for Repository Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add color-coding to CLI output to improve readability and distinguish between different types of repository actions and message severity levels
### Details:
Use the 'rich' library to implement colored text output. Define a color scheme for different message types (e.g., green for success, yellow for warnings, red for errors, blue for information). Create utility functions that wrap output messages with appropriate styling. Update existing CLI output calls to use these new utility functions. Ensure consistent color usage across the application. Include a configuration option to disable colors for environments that don't support them.

## 2. Add Progress Bars for Long-running Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement progress indicators for operations that take significant time to complete, improving user experience by providing visual feedback
### Details:
Use the 'tqdm' or 'rich.progress' module to implement progress bars. Identify all long-running operations in the codebase (e.g., repository scanning, batch processing). Modify these operations to track and report progress. Implement a consistent progress bar style that works with the colored output from subtask 1. Add estimated time remaining when possible. Ensure progress bars degrade gracefully in non-interactive environments. Add an option to disable progress bars for CI/CD environments.

## 3. Create Summary Reports with Filtering Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement end-of-operation summary reports that provide an overview of actions taken and recommendations, with filtering capabilities
### Details:
Design a structured format for summary reports that shows counts of different action types, recommendations, and outcomes. Implement filtering options (--filter flag) that allow users to view specific types of actions (e.g., --filter=warnings, --filter=errors, --filter=recommendations). Create tabular views of the filtered data using rich.table. Add the ability to export reports in different formats (text, JSON, CSV). Ensure summary reports use the colored output system from subtask 1. Include timing information about how long operations took, leveraging the progress tracking from subtask 2.
