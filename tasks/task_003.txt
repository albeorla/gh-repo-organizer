# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Repository Pattern for Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create proper persistence abstractions using the Repository pattern
# Details:
Define repository interfaces in the domain layer. Implement concrete repository classes in the infrastructure layer. Create a unit of work pattern if needed for transaction management. Ensure repositories handle the persistence of domain entities and aggregates. Implement in-memory repositories for testing purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for repository implementations using in-memory repositories. Test CRUD operations and any custom query methods. Verify that repositories properly maintain the integrity of domain models.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Repository Interfaces in Domain Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create repository interfaces that define the contract for data access operations for each domain entity or aggregate
### Details:
Create an IRepository<T> generic interface in the domain layer that defines standard CRUD operations (Get, GetAll, Add, Update, Delete). Then create specific interfaces for each domain entity (e.g., IUserRepository, IProductRepository) that extend the generic interface and add domain-specific query methods. Each interface should focus on domain concepts rather than persistence details.

## 2. Implement Unit of Work Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the Unit of Work interface to manage transactions and coordinate multiple repository operations
### Details:
Define an IUnitOfWork interface in the domain layer that will manage transactions and coordinate work across multiple repositories. This interface should include methods for committing transactions (SaveChanges/Commit) and properties to access each repository. The UnitOfWork will be responsible for maintaining a single transaction context across multiple repository operations.

## 3. Implement Concrete Repository Classes in Infrastructure Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create concrete implementations of the repository interfaces that handle the actual data access logic
### Details:
Implement concrete repository classes in the infrastructure layer that implement the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer. Create a generic Repository<T> base class that implements IRepository<T> and handles common CRUD operations. Then create specific repository implementations (e.g., UserRepository, ProductRepository) that inherit from the base repository and implement domain-specific query methods. Use the appropriate data access technology (EF Core, Dapper, etc.) in these implementations.

## 4. Implement Concrete Unit of Work Class [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create the concrete Unit of Work implementation that coordinates repositories and manages transactions
### Details:
Implement a concrete UnitOfWork class in the infrastructure layer that implements the IUnitOfWork interface. This class should maintain a single database context or connection, instantiate all required repositories, and provide transaction management through the SaveChanges/Commit method. Ensure proper disposal of resources by implementing IDisposable if necessary.

## 5. Implement In-Memory Repositories for Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create in-memory implementations of repositories and unit of work for testing purposes
### Details:
Implement in-memory versions of all repositories and the unit of work for use in unit tests. These implementations should store entities in memory collections (e.g., List<T>) rather than a database. Ensure these implementations fully respect the repository and unit of work interfaces. Create a factory or dependency injection setup that allows easily switching between real and in-memory implementations. Include sample tests that demonstrate the in-memory repositories in action.
