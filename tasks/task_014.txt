# Task ID: 14
# Title: Consolidate Directory Structure in src/repo_organizer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the refactor plan produced by Task 12; move files, update imports, docs, and tests.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Create a directory migration plan document [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a detailed migration plan document that outlines the current directory structure and the target structure. Identify all files that need to be moved, renamed, or modified.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Review the refactor plan from Task 12
2. Create a spreadsheet or document that lists:
   - Each file's current location
   - Each file's target location
   - Required import changes
   - Tests that need updating
   - Documentation that needs updating
3. Identify potential circular dependencies that might arise
4. Document any special considerations for specific modules
5. Create a rollback plan in case of issues

Testing approach: Have the document reviewed by team members to ensure completeness and accuracy.

## 2. Create new directory structure [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create the new directory structure according to the migration plan, without moving files yet. This includes creating new directories and placeholder files to ensure the structure is correct.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Based on the migration plan, create all new directories in the src/repo_organizer folder
2. Create __init__.py files in each directory as needed
3. Add placeholder README.md files in each directory explaining its purpose
4. Document the directory structure in project documentation
5. Verify the structure matches the migration plan

Testing approach: Manually verify all directories exist and have proper initialization files. Run the application to ensure it still works with the empty directory structure in place.

## 3. Move and update core files with minimal dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Move the files with minimal dependencies to their new locations and update their imports. This includes utility files, constants, and base classes that don't depend on many other modules.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Identify files with minimal dependencies from the migration plan
2. Move these files to their new locations
3. Update import statements within these files
4. Update any relative imports that reference these files in other modules
5. Run tests to ensure these files work correctly in their new locations

Testing approach: Run unit tests for each moved file. Verify that imports work correctly by running the application and checking for import errors.

## 4. Move and update complex modules and their dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Move the more complex modules to their new locations and update all import statements. Handle circular dependencies and ensure all modules can find their dependencies.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Move complex modules according to the migration plan
2. Update import statements in these modules
3. Update any modules that import these complex modules
4. Resolve any circular dependencies that arise
5. Refactor code as needed to maintain functionality
6. Run tests after moving each module to catch issues early

Testing approach: Run unit tests and integration tests after moving each module. Test the application functionality to ensure it works with the new structure.

## 5. Update and fix tests to work with new directory structure [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Update all test files to work with the new directory structure. This includes updating imports, test fixtures, and test paths.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Identify all test files that need updating
2. Update import statements in test files
3. Update test fixtures that reference file paths
4. Update any test configuration files
5. Fix any broken tests resulting from the directory changes
6. Run the full test suite to ensure all tests pass

Testing approach: Run the full test suite and verify all tests pass. Check test coverage to ensure it remains the same or improves.

## 6. Update documentation and finalize the refactoring [done]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Update all documentation to reflect the new directory structure, including README files, API documentation, and developer guides. Perform final testing and cleanup.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Update the main README.md file with the new directory structure
2. Update API documentation to reflect new import paths
3. Update developer guides and contribution guidelines
4. Update any diagrams or visual representations of the codebase
5. Remove any temporary files or placeholders created during migration
6. Perform a final cleanup of unused imports or dead code
7. Run a full application test to ensure everything works correctly

Testing approach: Perform full application testing, including all features. Have team members review the updated documentation for accuracy and completeness.
