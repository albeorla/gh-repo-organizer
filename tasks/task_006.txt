# Task ID: 6
# Title: Complete Adapter Implementations with Composition Pattern
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement all adapters using the composition pattern and remove legacy implementations
# Details:
Complete adapter implementations for external services (GitHub API, LLM providers). Use composition pattern to build adapters. Create adapter factories if needed. Implement proper error handling and retries. Remove legacy implementations once new adapters are fully tested.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite for adapters. Use mock servers or recorded responses for external APIs. Test error handling and edge cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Adapter Interfaces and Composition Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core adapter interfaces and structure for external service integration using the composition pattern
### Details:
Define clear interfaces for each external service type (GitHub API, LLM providers). Create abstract adapter classes that implement these interfaces. Design composition structure where adapters delegate to concrete service implementations. Include methods for configuration, connection management, and common operations. Document the design patterns and approach for the team.

## 2. Implement GitHub API Adapters with Composition [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build GitHub API adapters using the composition pattern with proper error handling and retry mechanisms
### Details:
Create concrete adapter implementations for GitHub API using the interfaces defined in subtask 1. Implement composition by wrapping the GitHub client library. Add error handling for API rate limits, network failures, and authentication issues. Implement exponential backoff retry logic for transient errors. Include logging for debugging. Write unit tests with mocked GitHub responses to verify adapter behavior.

## 3. Implement LLM Provider Adapters with Composition [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build adapters for all LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) using the composition pattern with standardized error handling
### Details:
Create concrete adapter implementations for each LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) using the interfaces from subtask 1. Use composition to wrap provider-specific client libraries. Implement standardized error handling for token limits, API outages, and quota issues. Create adapter factories to instantiate the appropriate LLM adapter based on configuration. Build unit tests for each provider adapter with mocked responses. Ensure consistent behavior across different providers.

## 4. Migrate from Legacy Implementations and Validate [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Replace legacy adapter implementations with new composition-based adapters and validate functionality
### Details:
Identify all usage of legacy adapters in the codebase. Create a migration plan with gradual replacement strategy. Implement feature flags to toggle between legacy and new adapters for safe rollout. Write integration tests comparing outputs of legacy and new adapters. Monitor performance metrics and error rates during migration. Document any API changes or behavioral differences. Remove legacy code once new adapters are fully validated in production environment.
