# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create CLI interface with Typer and Rich
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the command-line interface with rich formatting for user interaction and progress visualization.
# Details:
1. Set up Typer CLI application structure
2. Implement 'analyze' command with options for repository selection and analysis
3. Create 'cleanup' command for housekeeping
4. Implement progress visualization using Rich library
5. Add color coding for different actions and outputs
6. Create help documentation for commands
7. Implement command-line argument parsing
8. Add environment variable handling for configuration

# Test Strategy:
Test CLI commands with mock application layer. Verify command-line argument parsing. Test progress visualization with different repository counts. Ensure help documentation is complete and accurate. Validate environment variable handling.
