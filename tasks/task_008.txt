# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop action recommendation system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the core recommendation logic to generate actionable suggestions (DELETE/ARCHIVE/EXTRACT/KEEP/PIN) with detailed reasoning.
# Details:
1. Refine action recommendation algorithms based on repository characteristics
2. Implement detailed reasoning generation for each recommendation
3. Create priority assignment for recommendations (High/Medium/Low)
4. Implement strength and weakness analysis based on repository data
5. Add value assessment logic (High/Medium/Low)
6. Create activity assessment based on commit history
7. Implement tagging system for repository categorization

# Test Strategy:
Test recommendation logic with various repository scenarios. Verify reasoning generation for different actions. Test priority assignment algorithm. Validate strength and weakness analysis with different repository characteristics. Ensure value and activity assessments are consistent.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement core recommendation algorithms and reasoning engine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational logic to generate the five action types (DELETE/ARCHIVE/EXTRACT/KEEP/PIN) based on repository characteristics with reasoning generation.
### Details:
Develop algorithms that analyze repository data to determine appropriate actions. Implement the core decision tree or rule-based system that evaluates repository characteristics (size, activity, content) to generate recommendations. Create functions that produce detailed reasoning for each recommendation type, explaining why a specific action is suggested. Include repository characteristic assessment (points 1 and 2 from the parent task) and implement the reasoning generation component that explains each recommendation with clear justification.

## 2. Develop repository analysis components [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement the repository evaluation modules for strengths/weaknesses analysis, value assessment, and activity tracking.
### Details:
Build on the core recommendation engine by adding specialized analysis components: 1) Create the strength and weakness analyzer that identifies positive and negative aspects of repositories; 2) Implement value assessment logic that categorizes repositories as High/Medium/Low value based on content, usage patterns, and potential utility; 3) Develop the activity assessment module that analyzes commit history, frequency of updates, and contributor patterns to determine repository activity levels. These components will feed data to the core recommendation engine to improve decision quality.

## 3. Implement prioritization and categorization systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create the priority assignment system and tagging mechanism to categorize repositories and prioritize recommendations.
### Details:
Finalize the recommendation system by implementing: 1) A priority assignment algorithm that evaluates recommendation importance as High/Medium/Low based on repository analysis data; 2) A tagging system that categorizes repositories by purpose, technology, domain, or other relevant attributes; 3) Integration logic that combines all components to deliver a complete recommendation with action type, detailed reasoning, priority level, and relevant tags. Implement unit tests to verify correct prioritization and categorization based on different repository characteristics.
