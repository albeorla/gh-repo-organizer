# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop action recommendation system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core recommendation logic to generate actionable suggestions (DELETE/ARCHIVE/EXTRACT/KEEP/PIN) with detailed reasoning.
# Details:
1. Refine action recommendation algorithms based on repository characteristics
2. Implement detailed reasoning generation for each recommendation
3. Create priority assignment for recommendations (High/Medium/Low)
4. Implement strength and weakness analysis based on repository data
5. Add value assessment logic (High/Medium/Low)
6. Create activity assessment based on commit history
7. Implement tagging system for repository categorization

# Test Strategy:
Test recommendation logic with various repository scenarios. Verify reasoning generation for different actions. Test priority assignment algorithm. Validate strength and weakness analysis with different repository characteristics. Ensure value and activity assessments are consistent.
