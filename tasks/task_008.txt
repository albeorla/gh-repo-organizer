# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop CLI Command Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a proper command structure for the CLI interface
# Details:
Create command structure in `cli/` directory. Implement command pattern for CLI operations. Add commands for repository actions (analyze, list, filter, implement). Use a library like Click or Typer for CLI implementation. Ensure commands have proper help text and documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Test CLI commands with various inputs. Create integration tests that exercise the CLI interface with mock services.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up CLI framework with core structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the CLI directory structure and set up the base framework using Typer
### Details:
Create the `cli/` directory structure with __init__.py and main.py files. Install and configure Typer as the CLI framework. Set up the main CLI entry point with app = typer.Typer() pattern. Implement basic CLI configuration including app name, version, and help text. Create a simple working CLI that can be invoked but doesn't yet have specific commands.

## 2. Implement command pattern and base classes [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Design and implement the command pattern architecture for all CLI operations
### Details:
Create a command pattern structure with a BaseCommand abstract class in cli/commands/base.py. Define the command interface with methods like execute(), validate(), etc. Implement command registration mechanism to dynamically discover and load commands. Create the directory structure for commands (cli/commands/) with appropriate __init__.py files. Document the command pattern approach and how new commands should be added.

## 3. Implement repository analysis commands [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Add commands for repository analysis operations (analyze, list, filter)
### Details:
Implement the 'analyze' command to scan repositories with appropriate arguments and options. Add the 'list' command to display repositories with filtering capabilities. Create the 'filter' command with various filtering options for repository selection. Each command should follow the command pattern established in subtask 2. Include proper argument validation, help text, and examples in command documentation. Connect these commands to the appropriate service layer functions.

## 4. Implement repository action commands and documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Add implementation-related commands and finalize CLI documentation
### Details:
Implement the 'implement' command for repository code implementation with necessary options and arguments. Add any additional utility commands needed for the CLI workflow. Create comprehensive --help documentation for all commands with examples and usage patterns. Implement command autocompletion support. Test the complete CLI command structure with various workflows to ensure proper integration. Finalize the CLI documentation in both code and README.
