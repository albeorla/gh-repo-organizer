      "taskTitle": "Refactor Services to DDD Infrastructure Layer",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of moving services to the DDD infrastructure layer, including creating interfaces, updating imports, and testing the refactored services.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves moving files to new locations, creating interfaces, and updating imports throughout the codebase. The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding the existing code structure and ensuring all references are updated correctly. The risk of breaking existing functionality is significant."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Domain Models and Events",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement domain models for repository actions and the event system for cross-context communication, including model design, event creation, and handler implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it involves designing core domain models and implementing an event system. It requires deep understanding of DDD principles and careful design to ensure proper communication between bounded contexts. The event dispatcher mechanism adds additional complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Repository Pattern for Persistence",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Repository pattern, including interface design, concrete implementations, transaction management, and testing strategies.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing the Repository pattern requires careful design of interfaces and implementations. The complexity comes from ensuring proper persistence of domain entities while maintaining domain integrity. The addition of a unit of work pattern and in-memory repositories for testing increases the scope."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor Application Layer with Dependency Injection",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to refactor the application layer with dependency injection, including command/query separation, handler implementation, and container setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves significant architectural changes to the application layer. Implementing dependency injection and command/query separation requires careful design and refactoring. The task depends on the domain models and repositories being in place, adding to its complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Adapter Composition Pattern",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of adapters using the composition pattern, including interface design, concrete implementations, and migration from legacy code.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing the adapter composition pattern involves creating interfaces and concrete implementations, plus migrating from existing code. The complexity comes from ensuring proper translation between external systems and domain models while maintaining backward compatibility during transition."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Validation",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement configuration validation, including validation mechanism design, error handling, and service implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward compared to others. It involves creating validation mechanisms for configuration settings with clear error messages. Using a library like Pydantic could simplify implementation. The scope is well-defined and isolated."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive Test Suite",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of a comprehensive test suite, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and test fixtures for the new architecture.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive test suite for a complex system is highly challenging. It requires understanding all components and their interactions, developing appropriate test strategies for different layers, and ensuring good coverage. The dependency on multiple other tasks increases complexity."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Improve CLI Interface",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to improve the CLI interface, including command structure design, progress reporting, and filtering capabilities.",
      "reasoning": "Enhancing the CLI interface involves implementing a command pattern and improving output mechanisms. The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding user interaction patterns and implementing a clean command structure. The task depends on the application layer refactoring."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Repository Action Scripts",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of repository action scripts, including safety mechanisms, dry-run mode, confirmation prompts, and logging capabilities.",
      "reasoning": "Creating scripts for repository actions involves implementing both the action logic and safety mechanisms. The complexity comes from ensuring data safety, providing clear user feedback, and implementing proper logging. The dependency on the CLI interface adds some complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for final integration and regression testing, including test planning, execution, bug fixing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "Final integration testing is complex due to the need to verify all components working together correctly. It requires thorough test planning, execution, and fixing any regressions. The dependency on multiple other tasks makes this challenging as it needs to account for all possible interactions."
