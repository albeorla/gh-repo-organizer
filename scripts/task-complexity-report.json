      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of user authentication validation into specific subtasks, focusing on: (1) designing the central validation function, (2) integrating validation at entry points, (3) implementing error handling and user feedback, (4) adding security logging, and (5) updating interfaces and documentation. For each subtask, specify inputs, outputs, and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves cross-cutting changes across multiple modules, requiring careful coordination to ensure security is properly implemented. The validation logic needs to be integrated at all entry points, with proper error handling and logging. The task also requires interface updates and potential configuration changes, adding to its complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Audit and Consolidate Directory Structure in src/repo_organizer",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create detailed subtasks for consolidating the directory structure, including: (1) analysis and documentation of current structure with dependency mapping, (2) design of the proposed consolidated structure with migration plan, (3) implementation of refactoring with comprehensive import updates, and (4) testing and validation of the refactored structure. For each subtask, specify concrete deliverables and validation criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires deep architectural understanding and careful refactoring. The developer must analyze existing code, understand dependencies, and implement structural changes without breaking functionality. The need to maintain backward compatibility while simplifying architecture adds significant complexity. Historical context must also be considered, making this a high-complexity task."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Single Repository Limitation Mode",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the single repository limitation mode implementation into these subtasks: (1) design and implement the command-line interface and configuration options, (2) modify the repository scanning logic to support filtering, (3) adapt the report generation to handle single-repository mode with appropriate indicators, and (4) update documentation and add tests for the new functionality. For each subtask, define acceptance criteria and potential edge cases to consider.",
      "reasoning": "This feature requires modifications to multiple components including CLI, repository scanning, and report generation. While not as complex as a complete architectural refactoring, it still touches several parts of the codebase and requires careful consideration of backward compatibility and user experience. The dependencies on other tasks also add coordination complexity."
