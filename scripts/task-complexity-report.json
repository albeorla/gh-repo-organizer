      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of diagnosing and fixing the LangChain Claude Adapter's handling of repository data into precise steps, including code tracing, bug identification, prompt template verification, implementation of fixes, and updating documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires deep knowledge of LangChain adapters and LLM prompt handling. The root cause could span multiple layers: data extraction, serialization, prompt formatting, and API compatibility. Thorough tracing and validation are necessary, and the fix must not break existing integrations. Documentation and a possible validation step are also needed, making the task complex and multi-faceted."

      "taskTitle": "Run Repository Analysis Tool Across All User Repositories and Generate Comprehensive Report",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps required to run the analysis tool on all user repositories, including batch processing, result logging, report generation (with aggregation and visualization), error handling, configuration options, and output formatting.",
      "reasoning": "This task is substantial due to the need for scalable batch processing, robust error handling, comprehensive result aggregation, and clear reporting with visualizations. The technical challenges include performance optimization and ensuring resilience across many repositories, but the implementation is straightforward once the adapter issue is resolved."
